Poetry Club is a web service for community of creative people, united by common idea, where each member can expect a 
support from the others.

## How it works

Community, hosted by Poetry Club, has one administrator and arbitrary number of members. Each member (including 
the admin) has following responsibilities to the community:

1. Once a month they must publish some contribution.

2. Each of the member must read the contributions, made by other members and provide some feedback. It may be a 
constructive discussion, raised in social networks, or a share/repost.

A system aggregates the members activity and provides agenda for administrator, showing them the users who violate
the rules and don't support the community. Upon administrator's decision, they may be banned.
